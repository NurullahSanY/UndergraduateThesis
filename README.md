🔷 Transformer-Based Book Recommendation System
📚 A powerful recommendation engine using Transformer-based models (like BERT) to generate highly relevant book suggestions by understanding user-written reviews.

📝 Project Description
This project presents a book recommendation system that leverages state-of-the-art transformer architectures to analyze and extract meaning from user-generated textual reviews.

It focuses on overcoming the limitations of traditional rating-based systems by:

* Addressing rating uncertainty

* Enhancing recommendation accuracy

* Applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

⚙️ Key Components
🔄 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenizing, and preparing the dataset for effective training

❤️ Sentiment-Aware Embedding Generation: Utilizing transformer-based models to capture contextual sentiment and semantics

🎯 Model Fine-Tuning: Adapting pre-trained transformer models (like BERT) for the domain of book reviews

📈 Recommendation Engine: Suggesting relevant books based on user preferences derived from textual content

📂 Dataset
Source: Amazon Books Reviews – Kaggle

A comprehensive dataset containing millions of user reviews, ratings, and metadata for books on Amazon.

📌 Goals
Improve traditional recommendation techniques by integrating textual analysis

Experiment with different Transformer variants for better performance

Build a scalable model that can generalize across diverse review patterns

🛠️ Technologies Used
🧠 Transformers (BERT, etc.)

🐍 Python

🔡 NLTK / spaCy for text preprocessing

📊 Pandas, NumPy for data handling
