# Transformer-Based Book Recommendation System 
📚 A powerful recommendation engine using Transformer-based models (BERT) to generate highly relevant book suggestions by understanding user-written reviews.

## 📝Description
This project presents a book recommendation system that leverages state-of-the-art transformer architectures to analyze and extract meaning from user-generated textual reviews.

It focuses on overcoming the limitations of traditional rating-based systems by:

* Addressing rating uncertainty

* Enhancing recommendation accuracy

* Applying advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

### ⚙️ Key Components 
🔄 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenizing, and preparing the dataset for effective training

📊Sentiment-Aware Embedding Generation: Utilizing transformer-based models to capture contextual sentiment and semantics

🎯 Model Fine-Tuning: Adapting pre-trained transformer models (like BERT) for the domain of book reviews

📈 Recommendation Engine: Suggesting relevant books based on user preferences derived from textual content

### 📂 Dataset
Source: Amazon Books Reviews – [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews)

A comprehensive dataset containing millions of user reviews, ratings, and metadata for books on Amazon.

### 📌 Goals <br>
* Improve traditional recommendation techniques by integrating textual analysis

* Experiment with different Transformer variants for better performance

* Build a scalable model that can generalize across diverse review patterns

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
* Transformers (BERT)

* Python

* NLTK / spaCy for text preprocessing
  
* Pandas, NumPy for data handling

* Scikit-learn / PyTorch / TensorFlow for modeling and evaluation
